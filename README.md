Functions to interact with task card objects stored on Firebase.

# Usage

Buttons demonstrate the actions the UI will call.

`backendLib.js` has all the api calls to Firebase.

`index.js` declares all the event listeners

# Personal Note

[This](https://ojones.github.io/ethkan-firebase/) project was made to demostrate how to use Firebase as a temporary backend. This allows the frontend team to structure and store data on the fly. The backend team can then use Firebase data to inform their production services.
